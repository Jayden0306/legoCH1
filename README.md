  4) Set up git repo
     * Both are now contributers.
  5) Read the challenge 1 description.
      * We need to research biased random walk.
      * We think the walk shouldnt be too bad.
      * The sensors shouldnt be too much of a pain.
          * We want to have the ultrasonic mounted on top front,
          * two touch sensors in front.
      * Movement will be with treads for now.
